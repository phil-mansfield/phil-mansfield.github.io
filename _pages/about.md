I am a Ph.D student at the [University of Chicago](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/). I am a cosmologist and computational astrophysicist who studies dark matter halos and how they connect to the galaxies inside of them. You can find my papers on [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=AND&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FMansfield%2C%20P%2FMansfield%2C%20Philip%22&filter_database_fq_database=OR&filter_database_fq_database=database%3A%22astronomy%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_author%7D&fq_author=(author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FMansfield%2C%20P%2FMansfield%2C%20Philip%22)&fq_database=(database%3A%22astronomy%22)&q=author%3A(%22mansfield%2C%20philip%22)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) and [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DcN3RwQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My academic advisor is [Andrey Kravtsov](https://astro.uchicago.edu/~andrey/) and I am a research mentor for the undergrad Maria Neuzil.

I love teaching and outreach and have partnered with the University of Chicago's phenomenal [Office of Special Programs](https://osp-cp.uchicago.edu/) to teach physics, math, and engineering to Chicago high school students since 2016.
