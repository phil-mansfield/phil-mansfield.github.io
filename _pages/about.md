I am a computational astrophysicist and a KIPAC fellow at [Stanford University](https://kipac.stanford.edu/). I study the connection between observed galaxies and theoretical dark matter models, especialy satellite galaxies (small galaxies that orbit bigger ones). You can find my papers on [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/3Xkc2AFESfOHmHW0jSgPEg).

I love teaching and outreach. I have been a research mentor for seven graduate and undergraduate students, co-taught introductory astronomy at Stanford, and have partnered with the University of Chicago's phenomenal [Office of Special Programs](https://osp-cp.uchicago.edu/) to teach physics, math, and engineering to Chicago high school students.
