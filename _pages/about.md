I am a Ph.D student at the [University of Chicago](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/). I am a cosmologist and computational astrophysicist who studies dark matter halos and how they connect to the galaxies inside of them. My academic advisor is [Andrey Kravtsov](https://astro.uchicago.edu/~andrey/) and I am a research mentor for the undergrad Maria Neuzil.

I love teaching and outreach and have partnered with the University of Chicago's phenomenal [Office of Special Programs](https://osp-cp.uchicago.edu/) to teach physics, math, and engineering to Chicago high school students since 2016.
